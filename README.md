# password-generator

I made this project during my 'Visual Design & Front-End Development' minor at The Hague University of Applied Sciences. This was part of my Communication & Multi-media Design course.

I did the project design and coding myself. I used 'The Matrix' style in the design. I also added a tool that shows how strong a password is.

## Overview

### Functionality

- Generate a new password.
